# Death Stranding Material Unit Calculator

> A simple and intuitive web-based tool designed to help Porters in Death Stranding manage multiple construction projects, calculate material requirements, and track inventory with ease.

## About The Project

Ever find yourself juggling the material costs for paving multiple sections of road, or upgrading several structures at once? This tool solves that problem by moving beyond a single calculation and offering a full project management system.

The Death Stranding Material Unit Calculator helps you efficiently plan your resource gathering by allowing you to create and manage a list of projects. For each project, you specify the **total material needs**. Your **"You Have" inventory is global**, so you always know what's available in your private lockers. The calculator then shows the **net required amount** for your active project and breaks it down into the optimal number of in-game containers. When a project is finished, you can quickly update your inventory and even delete the project in one step. Keep on keeping on!

## ‚ú® Features

### Project Management
* **Multi-Project Support**: Create and manage an unlimited number of projects, perfect for tracking different road sections, zip-line networks, or structure upgrades.
* **Add, Rename, & Delete**: A dedicated sidebar allows you to easily add new projects, rename them on the fly with a pen icon, and delete them with a trash icon (complete with a confirmation step).
* **Persistent Projects & Inventory**: All your projects and your global inventory are saved to local storage, so your list is always there when you return.

### Material Calculation & Inventory
* **Per-Project Needs**: Enter the **Total Needed** amount for each material on a per-project basis.
* **Global Inventory**: The **"You Have"** fields represent your total available materials, shared across all projects.
* **Net Required Calculation**: Automatically determines the net amount of each material you still need to collect for the active project (`Total Needed - You Have`).
* **Optimal Unit Calculation**: Calculates the best breakdown of units (e.g., containers of 400, 200, 100) for the `Net Required` amount to meet or exceed your goal.
* **Waste Tracking**: Clearly displays any "wasted" material from using larger containers, helping you manage resources efficiently.

### Workflow Tools
* **"Project Finished" with Delete Option**: When a project is complete, a confirmation modal allows you to deduct the required materials from your inventory and gives you the option to **simultaneously delete the project**.
* **Reset Needed Materials**: A dedicated button clears *only* the "Total Needed" fields for the active project, allowing you to plan a new set of requirements without affecting your inventory.
* **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Speed up your workflow with intuitive keyboard shortcuts for all dialogs.
