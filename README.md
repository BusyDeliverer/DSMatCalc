# Death Stranding Material Unit Calculator

> A simple and intuitive web-based tool designed to help Porters in Death Stranding calculate the required units of various materials, complete with features for easy input management and waste tracking.

## About The Project

Ever find yourself at a terminal needing to fabricate or upgrade a structure, but you're not sure exactly how many containers of Metals or Ceramics to grab from your private locker? This tool solves that problem.

The Death Stranding Material Unit Calculator helps you efficiently plan your resource gathering by taking your required material amounts and breaking them down into the optimal number of in-game units (e.g., containers of 400, 200, 100, 50). It also tracks any "wasted" materials, so you never have to guess again. Keep on keeping on!
